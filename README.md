An adaptation of the "Richard Ritterschlag" (also known as "Brandon The Brave" in the USA or "DÃ©fis de chevalier" in France) chidren's game.

Uses ASCII for board display (because it is challenging).

Built in Elm because it's a language so great it gives me tears of joy every time I practice it.

WARNING: not playable yet

# Installation

Building the elm bundle at the right place is enough:

```
elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js
```

Then open the `index.html` file with your browser and that's all.
